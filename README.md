# "Moviebase App"

### Features

- Searchbar allows for the filtering of thousands of movies and displays them in the "Movies" section.
- Click on one of the movie posters on either the "Movies" list or the "Favorites" list to learn more information about the selected movie. (Click the "x" or anywhere outside the info card to close it.)
- Hover a movie poster to display the "Add to Favorites" button. Clicking will save the movie to your favorites list.
- Favorite movies are saved to local storage so that you will only have to add your favorite films to the list once!
